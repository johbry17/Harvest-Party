# Lindos Amigos,

What this year really needs, is more cowbell. And fall revelry. And your closest friends, with maybe some new ones, too! Join us on **Saturday, October 21st** for **HARVEST PARTY TEN (HPX)**, the annual celebration of all things fall. This will be a **DAYTIME PARTY** starting at **NOON**!

As usual, we will journey together into a dance/rave/kegger (*ahem* soiree) throughout the day but we have a hard stop at 10 – to avoid a visit from DC’s finest this year. #lifegoals

### We are providing:
- Beer (barrels of award-winning, locally made, fantastically-delish Fishbowl Brewing Co. beers)
- Badass vegan paella (by Burntwood Gardens)
- A safe space for everyone (including kids, dogs, frenemies, etc.)
<!-- - A fucking good time -->

### What you can expect:
- Local bands
- A bar stocked with cute bartenders, mixed drinks, and lots of great beers
- A pet-friendly event, calling all well-behaved dogs!
- 3-legged race (obvi)
- Flip cup, darts, giant Jenga, etc.

### All you really need to bring is your beautiful self! But if you’re feeling inspired, we encourage you to consider bringing:
- Chairs
- Hot dance moves
- Any other food/booze donations
- A musical instrument
- Anything else FUN and fall-themed
- Multiple bucks for the tip jar / Venmo jar (any excess donations will go to the Capital Area Food Bank)
- Chill dogs (on leash)
- Chill friends (optional leash)
- (Chili dogs not recommended)

Friends don't let friends miss Harvest Party. Come celebrate with us!
