# Lindos Amigos,

What this year really needs, is more cowbell. And fall revelry. And your closest friends, with maybe some new ones, too! Join us on **Saturday, October 21st, 2023** for **HARVEST PARTY TEN (HPX)**, the annual celebration of all things fall. This will be a **DAYTIME PARTY** starting at **NOON**!

As usual, we will journey together into a dance/rave/kegger (*ahem* soiree) throughout the day but we have a hard stop at 10 – to avoid a visit from DC’s finest this year. #lifegoals

### We are providing:
  <ul>Beer (barrels of award-winning, locally made, fantastically-delish Fishbowl Brewing Co. beers)</ul>
  <ul>Badass vegan paella (by Burntwood Gardens)</ul>
  <ul>A safe space for everyone (including kids, dogs, frenemies, etc.)</ul>
  <ul>A fucking good time</ul>

### What you can expect:
  <ul>Local bands</ul>
  <ul>A bar stocked with cute bartenders, mixed drinks, and lots of great beers</ul>
  <ul>A pet-friendly event, calling all well-behaved dogs!</ul>
  <ul>3-legged race (obvi)</ul>
  <ul>Flip cup, darts, giant Jenga, etc.</ul>

### All you really need to bring is your beautiful self! But if you’re feeling inspired, we encourage you to consider bringing:
  <ul>Chairs</ul>
  <ul>Hot dance moves</ul>
  <ul>Any other food/booze donations</ul>
  <ul>A musical instrument</ul>
  <ul>Anything else FUN and fall-themed</ul>
  <ul>Multiple bucks for the tip jar / Venmo jar (any excess donations will go to the Capital Area Food Bank)</ul>
  <ul>Chill dogs (on leash)</ul>
  <ul>Chill friends (optional leash)</ul>
